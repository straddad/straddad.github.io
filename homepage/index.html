			<p>You are a wise veteran wolf. You have hunted many times over and seen all there is to see in the life of a hunter. You have been through all the tricks and ploys in order to get your daily meals. You embark on your journey to the end of the forrest you regularly hunt and where the prey are an easy target. Unlike all the other days, today is special. You will encounter many trials before you get to your designated hunting ground where you will be tested on your wits and knowledge of the world. Choose carefully and continue to be the Great Wolf you are!<p>
