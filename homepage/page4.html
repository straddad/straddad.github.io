    	</h2>
    	<p>Continuing back on your path, as you reach towards the end of the village see a young Kid(baby goat) left on the roof of a sheep pen. Creeping near the edge, the young goat taunts and jeers at you as he feels safe on high ground. "I hear you," you explain, "and I haven't the least grudge against you for what you say or do. When you are up there it is the roof that's talking, not you." The Kid continues his act in confidence on the edge of the roof despite your wisdom.
