    	<p>On your route towards the forrest on the edge of the village, your ears pick up distant crying. As you get closer you see a mother holding her child.  “Hush, child, hush! Stop your crying”, the mother says, “or I will give you to the Wolf!” Surprised yet delighted at the thought of a meal, you think wether you should sit and wait for the mother’s promise as the baby boy continues to baffle out his cry.
