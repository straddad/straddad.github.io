            Further along your journey, as the sun begins to set, you finally make it to the beginning of the forest. While entering, you spot a lost Kid wondering about the forest. As he turned a corner of a tree he spots you and instantly pleads for his life. "Please, Mr. Wolf," he said tumbling, "I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can." Appreciative of the Kidâ€™s optimism, you consider his request for a song.
