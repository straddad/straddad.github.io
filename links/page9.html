            Eating the final scraps of the Donkey, you get a piece of bone stuck horizontally in your throat. After many attempts of coughing it up it just won't budge. Being stuck in this very uncomfortable position, The Crane approaches you to see what is all your fussing about. You notice its long neck and how useful The Crane’s dexterity would be in your predicament. "I will reward you very handsomely," you say, "if you pull this bone out for me with your beak.” The Crane, as you can imagine, was very uneasy about putting her head in your canine throat. But she was grasping in nature, so she did as you asked her to do.
