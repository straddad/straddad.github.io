			(Middle of village)
    	</h2>
    	<p>Though the middle outskirts of the village, you spot a lean dog. Scrawny from head to toe, ribs silhouetted through its skin. Due to your digression from hunger you could care less about how much meat is on the dog. As you pace towards the Lean Dog, he proposes a proposition. â€œHow unpleasant it would be to eat me now. Look at my ribs. I am nothing but skin and bone. But let me tell you something in private. In a few days my master will give a wedding feast for his only daughter. You can guess how fine and fat I will grow on the scraps from the table. Then is the time to eat me."
