             Further into the forest as your long journey towards the other side begins to come to an end, you encounter yet another prospect. A Donkey in the middle go the forest limping about moaning of pain. You approach the Donkey and ask what has made him lame. He tells you that a sharp thorn has punctured through his hooves and he is in dire pain. "Please pull it out," he pleaded, groaning in pain. "If you do not, it might stick in your throat when you eat me."
