  			<p>As you began to leave on your journey, you notice a sheep’s carcass from two nights ago in your lair. You come up with a ploy to disguise yourself as a sheep and sneak into the neighboring shepherd’s pasture hoping to snag a quick meal instead of traveling far to the end of the forrest. Should you enact on this scheme?
