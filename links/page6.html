        Continuing on your long-traveled journey, you come across The Shepard Boy. As you see him he screams out “WOLF WOLF!” You instantly hide in a bush next to you. Confused and frightened, you know the boy hasn’t laid eyes on you, yet he calls your name as if he sees you. As the townsmen rush to his aid he chuckles out a horrendous laugh spewing “I GOT YOU I GOT YOU”. The townsmen scold the boy for his ignorance and continue on with their chores into the village. Minutes go by and the boy shouts your name again, “WOLF WOLF”. Being that you are in the bush out of sight you are for certain that the boy is only playing tricks on the townsmen for his own entertainment. The townsmen come rushing in again for a second time just to be fooled by The Shepard Boy once again. Furious, they storm back into the village to tend to their work. You notice the pattern of the boy a plan to make an official appearance.
