    		Come night fall, the mother comes by the window singing and rocking her baby to sleep. "There, child, there! The Wolf shall not get you. No, no! Daddy is watching and Daddy will kill him if he should come near!" Suddenly after, the Father comes to spot you and sends his dogs after you. You are savagely torn apart by a pack of the manâ€™s best friend.
